# ScrapyProject
## Description
This is a project in which I used the Scrapy web scraping framework to parse sites as part of an employer's trial assignment.
## Requirements
For this project to work, you should download the latest version of Python (3.11).
The project was completely written in the PyCharm environment.
## Launch
To launch the project, you should use the terminal to go to the `quotetutorial` directory and write this command `scrapy crawl test -o items.json`
After executing the command, a json file will be created with the result of parsing the site.
